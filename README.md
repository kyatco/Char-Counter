## 🛠️ Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the project on your computer.

---

### 1. Install Node.js
Download and install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).  

Check your version to make sure it’s installed correctly:


### 2. Clone or Download the Project

If you have Git installed:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/char-counter.git
cd char-counter


If you don’t have Git, click the “Code → Download ZIP” button on GitHub, extract the folder, and then open it in your terminal.

### 3. Initialize & Install (first time only)

Inside the project folder, run:

```bash
npm init -y
```

This will create a package.json file.
Now, copy the provided package.json content (see below) into it.

### 4. Run the Example

Run the program with:

```bash
npm start
```

Expected output:

Input: hello world
Character counts: { h: 1, e: 1, l: 3, o: 2, ' ': 1, w: 1, r: 1, d: 1 }

### 5. Run the Tests

We also made a small test file to check the function. Run:

```bashß
npm test
```

Expected output:

Running tests...
{ a: 2, b: 1 }
{}
{ a: 2, ' ': 1 }
